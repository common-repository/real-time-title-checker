== Description ==

Real-time TITLE Checker is a plug-in that allows you to quickly search, narrow down, and check article titles that match keywords entered in the title column from articles you have posted so far.

What title did you put in other articles? What kind of naming convention was used for URLs? Recommended for those who want to confirm immediately.

== Installation ==

1. Upload this plugin to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
1. Activate "Real-time TITLE Checker" from WordPress's "plug-in" menu.

== Screenshots ==

1. If there are many search results, scroll to display.
2. You can also narrow down by entering two or more words.
